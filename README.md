<!-- HOW DOES IT WORK-->
## How does it work 📔
<p align="justify">
  Solitaire is a classic card game that involves building up a foundation of cards from Ace to King in each of the four suits. 
  The game starts with a tableau of seven piles of cards with one card face up in each pile.
  The game mechanics are to drag and drop cards to move them between piles. 
  Additionally, scripts have been added to allow for easy clicking on cards to speed up gameplay and make the overall experience more enjoyable.
